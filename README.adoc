. or clone the project and follow the instructions below

This project gives you the possibility to *work on the same AsciiDoc file with a team and see the rendering in realtime*.

It's based on the {asciidoctor-url}[Asciidoctor project] thanks to : 

* the Java API provided by {asciidoctorj-url}[AsciidoctorJ]
* the Javascript libraries provided by {asciidoctorjs-url}[Asciidoctor.js]

   mvn clean package -Pwildfly-managed-arquillian

   .. if you haven't set the +$JBOSS_HOME+ env variable :

   mvn clean package -Pwildfly-managed-arquillian -DserverRoot=<path_to_the_server>
