== Asciidoctor WildFly module

This is the module you have to deploy on your WildFly server in order to make asciidoctor processor works:

=== Install the Asciidoctor module

. stop your server instance
. copy the +org+ directory to $JBOSS_HOME/modules
. you should have the files below :
.. $BOSS_HOME/modules/org/asciidoctor/main/module.xml
.. $BOSS_HOME/modules/org/asciidoctor/main/asciidoctor-java-integration-0.1.4.jar
.. $BOSS_HOME/modules/org/asciidoctor/main/jruby-complete-1.7.4.jar
. start your server

Then the wWSmAD project configure the +maven-war-plugin+ in order to generate a MANIFEST.MF file with :

* Dependencies: org.asciidoctor

It means that the WAR depends on Asciidoctor module so that no AsciidoctorJ libraries are present in WEB-INF/lib and the processor 
will work whatever your system configuration

=== Errors you should not have if your installation is OK
