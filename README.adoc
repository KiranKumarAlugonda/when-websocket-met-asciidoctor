== Features on 0.1.0-Alpha1

* By default when you click to +connect+, you are a +*reader*+ :
** It means that you can see what happens on HTML5 preview but you can't send any source version
* When you +add a name+ and click to +Enable editor+, you become a +*writer*+ :
** so you can update the asciidoc source in realtime and automatically view HTML 5 rendered :
*** *each time you write something* if you have clicked on +Send On Change+
*** *each time you press "Ctrl+S"* if you have clicked on +Send On Ctrl+S+ button
* You can *patch your file with the latest asciidoc source*:
** if an other author send a version, you can click on +Compute Diff+ button to see differences between your adoc file and the last adoc file
** if the patch seems ok, click on +Apply Patch+ and you adoc source will be up to date
* *Several people can work* on the same doc
** you can see the number of writers (people who send adoc file)
** you can see the name of the last author
** ypu can see the numbr of readers (people who don't send an asciidoc source)
